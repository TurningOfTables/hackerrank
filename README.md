# HackerRank Solutions - Go

A repo to collect together my solutions to some of the HackerRank problems I've submitted to as I learn.

All should have at least a basic test in the `<challenge>_test.go` file, and a comment. The relevant HackerRank problem link is in the `<challenge>.go` file Some have benchmarks and examples for multiple solutions.
